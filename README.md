# Portfolio (Next.js)

This is a minimal Next.js portfolio scaffold populated with your profile, education, experience, projects, and skills.

Quick start

```powershell
# install
npm install

# dev server
npm run dev
```

Notes

- Deploy to Vercel for zero-config Next.js hosting.
- To add Tailwind or other styling, I can integrate it next if you want.
